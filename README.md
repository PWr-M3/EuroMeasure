# EuroMeasure
EuroMeasure is a standard we have established. It describes our measurement devices on every level:
  A. Mechanical     EuroMeasure-compatible devices are based upon EuroCard 100mmx100mm module. The modules
                    fit into a standard size EuroCard rack system. Each card is 4U wide (20mm). Each card
                    has up to 3 IDC 10 sockets. (Power, Data bus, Programmer)
  B. Electrical     The power plug pinout is based on EuroRack standard. It delivers +/-15V and 5V rails
                    Data bus uses an I2C bus, contains free GPIO pins and a lockout pin that enables all
                    HV voltage sources
